# Coding test
I read all text words from the file and store it in a string array variable to enable me easily query it using Linq. To get the most used word can be achieved in several ways. I found using LINQ in .Net Framework faster and easer since i have already store all the words in a collection. Using linq i can easily query and manipulate each string in the array.
