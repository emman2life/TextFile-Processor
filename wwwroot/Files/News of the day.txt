Doctors who'd gone on strike indefinitely in Nigeria after not being paid for months have called it off "for the sake of humanity".

"Considering the recent coronavirus cases in the country and the commitment shown by stakeholders in the health sector" they would suspend their strike, the Nigeria Association of Resident Doctors added in the statement.

Nigeria confirmed four new cases of coronavirus on Sunday, bringing its total to 30.

The Nigerian Centre for Disease Control confirmed that all the new cases had travelled from high-risk countries in the last week. Officials say they have started to track down people they may have been in contact with.

Meanwhile, measures to stop the spread of the disease are being stepped up. Rail passenger services and international flights to Nigeria will be suspended on Monday, and people will be banned from standing in buses if all the seats are occupied.
